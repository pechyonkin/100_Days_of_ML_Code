## Day 19. January 28, Monday.

Today I continued doing research for my blog post about MXNet. I watched CS231n 2017 [Lecture 7](https://youtu.be/6wcs6szJWMY) (I actually watched it before, this is how I knew I needed to rewatch it) and that clarified a lot about deconvolutions and visualization of convolutional networks. I think my next project will be visualizing convnets using different methods outlined in the lecure using PyTorch.

## Day 18. January 27, Sunday.

Today I started writing an overview of the [ZFNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2901) for my [website](https://pechyonkin.me/architectures/).

While doing it I got confused about convolutions, transposed convolutions and backprop throught them. That finally got me to read the [Guide to Convolution Arithmetic for Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07285) (with [awesome GIFs](https://github.com/vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic)). That clarified it a lot.

## Day 17. January 26, Saturday.

Today I [learned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdZ4HF1SrFs) that Python has `while-else` and `for-else` loops. The `else` clause is evaluated once when the loop condition becomes false. It won't be evaluated if there is a break statement or an error thrown inside the while loop.

## Day 16. January 25, Friday.

Worked on Jeremy's PyTorch tutorial. PyTorch is much more pleasing than TF. Will add more details later.

### Notes:

- formula for iterations: `for i in range((i - 1) // bs + 1)`. I worked it on paper and can explain it by example, but somehow this *doesn't click* and there is no aha moment with it yet.
- `Sequential`
- You can create a custom layer by subclassiing `nn.Module`
- Python: when subclassing, in `.__init__(self)` you have to call `super().__init__()` to initialize parent class
- any `nn.Parameter` assigned to `.self.<varname>` inside `nn.Module` subclass's `.__init()` will be added to model parameters and can be optimized
- `torch.optim` has optimizers
- `torch.utils.data` has:
	- `TensorDataset` - builds a dataset from tensors
	- `DataLoader` - builds iterable dataloader from dataset, needs to know batch size
- call `model.train()` when optimizing (training) and `model.eval()` before inference (e.g. validation). This is needed for dropout, batchnorm and some other layers to work properly (they have different regimes for training and inference)
- `tensor.view()` - the same as `np.ndarray.resize()`. It is actually a view on data in memory, because data is not changed / moved in memory when you call this method.
- `tensor.item()` gives scalar for a tensor of only one value
- `tensor.size(d)` gives shape of tensor across dimension `d`
- nice trick to create tensors from numpy arrays by mapping `torch.tensor`:
```python
x_tr, y_tr, x_val, y_val = map(
    torch.tensor, (x_tr, y_tr, x_val, y_val)
)
```
- main idea of training steps (generally applies to deep learning):
	1. forward pass: `pred = model(xb)`
	2. calculate loss: `loss = loss_func(pred, yb)`
	3. backward pass, calculates gradients for `model.parameters()`: `loss.backward()`
	4. perform update of parameters accoridng to specific optimizer and learning rate: `opt.step()`
	5. zero out gradients: `opt.zero_grad()`
		- Stackoverflow: [Why do we need to explicitly call zero_grad()?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44732217/why-do-we-need-to-explicitly-call-zero-grad)
		- Basically we can use gradient accumulation across batched, that's why.

## Day 15. January 24, Thursday.

I continued with Jeremy Howard's PyTorch tutorial I started yesterday. Did not finish yet. But I have to say that after TensorFlow, PyTorch is a piece of cake. Much more pythonic and elegant, simple syntax and ideas. By comparison, TF feels like a monstrocity piece of software.

I also transferred three articles from Medium to my personal blog:

1. [Key deep learning architectures page](https://pechyonkin.me/architectures/), that I will update as I write more review of architectures (originally [here](https://medium.com/@pechyonkin))
2. [LeNet-5 overview](https://pechyonkin.me/architectures/lenet/) (originally [here](https://medium.com/@pechyonkin/key-deep-learning-architectures-lenet-5-6fc3c59e6f4))
3. [AlexNet overview](https://pechyonkin.me/architectures/alexnet/) (originally [here](https://medium.com/@pechyonkin/key-deep-learning-architectures-alexnet-30bf607595f1))

## Day 14. January 23, Wednesday.

### 1. Leafy Greens Project

I finished cleaning data, more than 75% of original downloaded images were removed. Most of them are images of foods containing greens that I was looking for. I went from more than 8000 images across 29 classes to a bit more than 2000. I spent hours cleaning all that.

Then I built a classifier that achieved 22% error rate, which is high, but satisfactory given very similar classes and small dataset with low quality images.

Mostly the classifier got confused on very similar greens. Examples:

- cilantro and parsley
- cilantro and celery
- choy sum and gai lan (Chinese broccoli
- tricolor daisy and crown daisy
- watercress and pea shoots

This is further set back by the fact that data is not of very high quality and not very big size.

At this point, I am satisfied with result (22% error rate, about 88 mistakes out of 401 validation examples) because the cost of acquiring more data is not very interesting to me for learning purposes.

The next step will be to deploy this model as a web-app for learning purposes.

### 2. What is `torch.nn` really?

I decided to follow along with "[What is torch.nn really?](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html)" tutorial, typing along in a dedicated [notebook](https://github.com/pechyonkin/learning-pytorch/blob/master/torch-really.ipynb) by hand to train muscle memory, exploring PyTorches basics. So far PyTorch seems much more intuitive and easy than TensorFlow. No wonder fastai decided to use it as their backend.
 

## Day 13. January 22, Tuesday.

I finally got to start cleaning the data. I learned that it is a very boring task, taking a lot of time. And also, Google image search for Chinese terms gives very low quality images. I probably deleted 40-50% of all downloaded images.

## Day 12. January 21, Monday.

Today I finished and finally published an [article](https://pechyonkin.me/deep-learning-vision-non-vision-tasks/) about creative application of deep learning vision to non-vision tasks.

### Useful Links

My yesterday's [tweet](https://twitter.com/max_pechyonkin/status/1086852019376308224) sharing the articleabout `.einsum` from yesterday unexpectedly got popular. Some people shared other posts about it, so I am deepening my understanding of `.einsum`. Two new posts about it read today.

- [Programmer Competency Matrix](https://sijinjoseph.com/programmer-competency-matrix/)

## Day 11. January 20, Sunday.

Today is mostly reading day.

- When reading source code for [`numpy.einsum`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html), I discovered that you can [`.pop`](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/v1.15.4/numpy/core/einsumfunc.py#L1224) values from a dict. Python is amazing!
- **Inner product** of two vectors -> scalar. Another way to think is inner product = row vector x column vector.
- **Outer product** of two vectors -> matrix. Another way to think is that outer product = column vector x row vector.
- **Matrix L2 norm** is the square root of the sum of all squared elements.

Note that both [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html?highlight=einsum#torch.einsum) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/einsum) have their own versions of `.einsum`.

## Day 10. January 19, Saturday.

Today I made a notebook and downloaded the data for my [green leafy vegetables](https://github.com/pechyonkin/culinary-herbs-classifier) classifier. The data is really dirty - a lot of irrelevant images. I will have to spend a lot of time cleaning the data for 29 classes tomorrow.

## Day 9. January 18, Friday.

To get some data for my green leafy herbs I went to a closest vegetables market and recorded all Chinese names of green leafy things. I got a list of 30. Then I went back and meticuluosly converted all of them into [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin) and also translated to English. You can find the list [here](https://github.com/pechyonkin/culinary-herbs-classifier).

## Day 8. January 17, Thursday.

I started a green leafy culinary herbs classifier. Many culinary herbs look the same to me. So I decided to do this project as homework for fastai v3 lesson 2. My goals for this project:

- use lesson 2 functionality to download images from Google (haven't done it before)
- train a model using transfer learning, preferrably get good performance
- deploy a model (haven't done it before)
- use [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) framework as recommnded in class (haven't done it befor)

Out of 4 goals 3 are new to me. So I will do a lot of learning for this project.

## Day 7. January 16, Wednesday.

Today I finished fastai part 1 v3 lesson 2.

I also set up repos for development of fastai and fastai_docs so that I can contribute to these libraries. There are some standards of contribution, such as stripping notebooks of outputs when committing, the instructions are:

- for [`fastai`](https://docs.fast.ai/dev/develop.html)
- for [`fastai_docs`](https://github.com/fastai/fastai_docs)
- [doc](https://docs.fast.ai/gen_doc_main.html) about authoring fastai docs

Today [my first pull request](https://github.com/fastai/course-v3/pull/138#issuecomment-454647053) to the fastai library was merged. It is a very small change, but I am still happy. So I decided to deepen my knowledge about how to contribute. To summarize, the steps are below (taken from [here](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/)).

#### Steps to contribute to fastai

1. Fork the project & clone locally. 
2. Create an upstream remote.
	- `git remote add upstream git@github.com:fastai/course-v3.git`
3. sync your local copy before you branch.
	- `git checkout master`
	- `git pull upstream master && git push origin master`
3. Branch for each separate piece of work.
	- `git checkout -b hotfix/readme-update` (`hotfix/readme-update` is branch name)
4. Do the work, write [good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), and read the CONTRIBUTING file if there is one.
5. Push to your origin repository.
	- `git push -u origin hotfix/readme-update` (the `-u` flag links this branch with the remote one, so that in the future, you can simply type `git push origin`)
6. Create a new PR in GitHub.
7. Respond to any code review feedback.

## Day 5. January 12, Saturday.

### Reading

Today is a reading day. Topics related to data science and careers in data science.

A very nice blog by Tim Hopper:

4. [A Subjective and Anecdotal FAQ on Becoming a Data Scientist](https://tdhopper.com/blog/faq/)

### Coding

Today I fixed the issue with train-validation-test split used for `.from_csv()` in `fastai` library in my [102 flowers classifier]().

I made folders so that I could have dataset as per [ImageDataBunch.from_csv()](https://docs.fast.ai/vision.data.html#ImageDataBunch.from_csv).

We will have to have structure like this:

```
path/
  /train
  /test
  labels.csv
```

In addition, `labels.csv` has to have structure like:

```
filename_1, category
filename_2, category
       ...,      ...
filename_n, category
```

**Notes**:

- I looked at [source code](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/fastai/vision/data.py#L132) to figure out the proper way to set up data set structure. Basically, `.from_csv` calls `.from_df()` under the hood. And that calls `.create_from_ll()` which in itself sets up the test folder properly. Test folder parameter is passed through as `**kwargs` all the way from `.from_csv()`.

- `test` parameter should be a folder of images. By default `labels.csv` will be used as train data with random split given by the parameter `valid_pct`. So I used both `train.txt` and `valid.txt` coming with the original 102 flowers data set to generate `labels.csv`. Then I used `test.txt` to generate `labels_test.csv` that can be used for testing later. Note that `labels_test.csv` is not used in training directly, it can only be used later to assess out-of-sample performance of the model.

- `folder` parameter is the root directory realative to which paths in `labels.csv` will be loaded as data. By default it is `.` which is current directory.

- after the proper split I have 2039 images for train and validation. With the default 20% validation this means 1627 images for training and 412 images for validation. Official test set for this data set is 6149 images. Because the train set is so small compared to improperly used yesterday, my today's best accuracy is about 8%. I can easily make it much better by using some data from test data set, but for now this is a good result.

## Day 4. January 11, Friday.

I finished my skin lesion classifier. Error rate about 7%. But true positive rate about 60% which is pretty low. Probably class imbalance. I will come back to this project later when I learn how to make a custom more balanced data set feeder with fastai.

I then started another mini project as homework for fastai v3 lesson 1 - [102 flower classifier](https://github.com/pechyonkin/flowers-classifier). Spend quite some time to sort the files into appropriate folders so that folder structure can be used by `ImageDataBunch.from_csv()`. Documentation is not very clear, test folder was used as training data, validation set was randomly created automatically even though one of the folders was called `valid/`. I will try to fix it tomorrow.

By the way, the data set is quite bad - the authors did not bother to provide a mapping from numerical class labels to actual class names. [This](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/categories.html) is the best they could come up with. It is not even in alphabetic order! Maybe it is a riddle where someone who wishes to use the dataset must manually label the data by using photograph count provided. Disappointment.

If you ever create your own data set - do not do it like this. People will thank you.

**TODO**: make a cheatsheet with common file system commands in Python: copy file, make file, create and close directories, check existence etc. All these functions are in different packages which makes is quite messy and hard to remember well.

### Nice Discovery

**TODO**: [This](https://github.com/ageron/tf2_course) tutorial on the upcoming TensorFlow 2.0 by Aurelien Geron.

## Day 3. January 10, Thursday.

Today I was able to run the pretrained fastai model, as per Lesson 1 instructions. At first I got an error and couldn't figure it out but then realized I had a parameter wrong, I used `tfms` instead of `ds_tfms` when creating my dataset object.

Then, training took too long. About 23000 images, 15 minutes per epoch for finetuning on resnet50. That is too slow, as it should take about 2-4 minutes, by my expectation. I then realized my CPU was loaded 100% and GPU power draw was only 80 watts out of 250 watts maximum. Clearly this is a CPU bottleneck, probably doing on the fly data augmentation and resizing. The images are all quite large and all different sizes, so this maybe is a contributing factor.

Maybe I will try to look into ways to optimize this - one way is to resize all images to 300 by 300 and then use those resized images during training.

On the good side, I was able to get to 7.85% error rate. I will try to do more tomorrow.

I also found a little bug in fastai part one version 3 course, I submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/fastai/course-v3/pull/138). Who knows, maybe it will get accepted.


## Day 2. January 9, Wednesday

Today I spent time additionally cleaning the data for skin lesion classifier. I decided to only go with 2 classes for now - malignant and benign.

I split the data into 3 groups Imagenet-style (each train, validation and test in their own folder, each has folders for each existing class):

- train - 80%
- validation - 10%
- test - 10%

Then I copied all the files into their corersponding folders and transferred them to the DL box to try fastai v3 lesson 1. I discovered that my virtual environment broke down so I had to spent time to reinstall it.

I am ready now to try and build a transfer learning classifier tomorrow, because my data is ready.

### Useful snippets from today

It turns out broadcasting works in Pandas similar to Numpy. Below is example of creating filenames with extension based on filenames and a given extension.

```python
df5['fname'] = df5['name'] + '.jpeg'
```

Dropping a column:

```python
df6.drop('name', axis=1, inplace=True)
```
Random integers with given probabilities:

```python
split_ints = np.random.choice([0,1,2], size=df6.shape[0], p=[0.8,0.1,0.1])
```
 Get a directory name based on a path string:
 
 ```python
 os.path.dirname('/Users/fazzl/data/isic/train/benign/ISIC_0026373.jpeg')
 ```

Remove the last 5 chars in a Pandas column of strings, I tried lambda and it unexpectedly worked as expected immidiately. Love such moments! Note: .stem and .name are parts of pathlib's Path.

- [`.stem`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.PurePath.stem) - the final path component, without its suffix - either a filename without extension or the last folder name
- [`.name`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.PurePath.name) - finlename in a given path, if any

```python
# map from filename without extension to filename with extension
images_fnames = {f.stem : f.name for f in Path('/Users/fazzl/data/isic-source/images').iterdir()}

# fix the names of files, some of the files are PNG
df6['fname'] = df6['fname'].apply(lambda x: images_fnames[x[:-5]])
```

Loop to copy files to produce Imagenet-style structure, where folder existence is checked at every iteration. Maybe not the most efficient way, but it worked well:

```python
for idx in df6.index:
    fname = df6.loc[idx]['fname']
    path = df6.loc[idx]['path']
    source_fname = SOURCE_PATH + fname
    target_fname = TARGET_PATH + path
    target_dir = os.path.dirname(target_fname)
    if not os.path.exists(target_dir):
        os.makedirs(target_dir)
    shutil.copy2(source_fname, target_fname)
```


## Day 1. January 8, Tuesday

Today I worked on cleaning [ISIC](https://isic-archive.com) skin cancer data for my [skin-lesion-classifier](https://github.com/pechyonkin/skin-lesion-classifier). Got more familiar with using Pandas to clean data.

### Some useful snippets are below

Combining 2 boolean masks to change a value:
```python
mask_null = df2['benign_malignant'].isnull()
mask_pgk = df2['diagnosis'] == 'pigmented benign keratosis'
df2.loc[mask_null & mask_pgk, 'benign_malignant'] = 'benign'
```

Drop rows with `NaNs` from the dataframe:
```python
idx_to_drop = df2[df2['benign_malignant'].isnull()].index
df3 = df2.drop(idx_to_drop)
```

Count values:
```python
df3['benign_malignant'].value_counts()
```

I also [finished writeup](https://pechyonkin.me/portfolio/breast-cancer-diagnostics/) of my Udacity MLND nanodegree capstone project. I will need to do another go at proofreading as I copied some text from PDF generated by LaTeX and it has line breaks in unexpected places.
