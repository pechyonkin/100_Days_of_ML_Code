# 100 Days of ML Code

[Inspired](https://github.com/llSourcell/100_Days_of_ML_Code) by Siraj Raval.

## Day 1. January 8, Tuesday.

Today I worked on cleaning [ISIC](https://isic-archive.com) skin cancer data for my [skin-lesion-classifier](https://github.com/pechyonkin/skin-lesion-classifier). Got more familiar with using Pandas to clean data.

Some useful snippets are below.

Combining 2 boolean masks to change a value:
```python
mask_null = df2['benign_malignant'].isnull()
mask_pgk = df2['diagnosis'] == 'pigmented benign keratosis'
df2.loc[mask_null & mask_pgk, 'benign_malignant'] = 'benign'
```

Drop rows with `NaNs` from the dataframe:
```python
idx_to_drop = df2[df2['benign_malignant'].isnull()].index
df3 = df2.drop(idx_to_drop)
```

Count values:
```python
df3['benign_malignant'].value_counts()
```

I also [finished writeup](https://pechyonkin.me/portfolio/breast-cancer-diagnostics/) of my Udacity MLND nanodegree capstone project. I will need to to another go at proofreading as I copied some text from PDF generated by LaTeX and it has line breaks in unexpected places.
